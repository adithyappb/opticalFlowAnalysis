Optical Flow Analysis:
This project demonstrates real-time optical flow estimation using OpenCV with GStreamer for camera input.

Features:
1) Optical Flow Calculation: Uses OpenCV to compute optical flow between consecutive video frames.
2) GStreamer Integration: Captures camera frames using GStreamer pipeline for efficient video processing.
3) Visualization: Displays optical flow vectors overlaid on video frames in real-time.

Requirements:
1) OpenCV
2) GStreamer
   
Build the Project:
1) cd opticalFlowAnalysis/src/build
2) cmake ..
3) make

Run the Application:
./optical_flow_demo
